Hulk is a 2003 American superhero film based on the fictional Marvel Comics character of
 the same name. Ang Lee directed the film, which stars Eric Bana as Dr. Bruce Banner, as well
 as Jennifer Connelly, Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Nick Nolte. The film explores the origins of
 Bruce Banner, who after a lab accident involving gamma radiation finds himself able to turn
 into a huge green-skinned monster whenever he gets angry, while he is pursued by the
 United States military and comes into a conflict with his father.

Development for the film started as far back as 1990. The film was at one point to be
 directed by Joe Johnston and then Jonathan Hensleigh. More scripts had been written by 
Hensleigh, John Turman, Michael France, Zak Penn, J. J. Abrams, Scott Alexander and Larry 
Karaszewski, Michael Tolkin, and David Hayter before Ang Lee and James Schamus' involvement.
 Hulk was shot mostly in California, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Hulk was a commercial success, grossing over $245 million worldwide, higher than its $137
 million budget, earning praise for its visual effects, ambition, performances and complexity
 (especially compared with other superhero films released at that time), while the film's pacing, 
tone, Hulk’s CGI aspects and lack of more action were subjects of criticism. A reboot, titled 
The Incredible Hulk, was released on June 13, 2008 as the second film of the Marvel Cinematic
 Universe.
